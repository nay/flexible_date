FlexibleDate
============

FlexibleDate plugin provides the better handling of date columns.
With flexible_date_select helper, you can receive invalid data such as {:year => '2010', :month => '', :day => '3'} and
validate it automatically, while you can also keep that value for error messages.

You can get the string value such as '2009-01-01' if you specify the options to flexible_date_column.
(But this plugin does not provide the helper for the string.)

This plugin has been tested on Rails 2.3.3.

Example
=======

It your model class which has the target date column, you can write like this;

class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base

  flexible_date_column :started_on # You have started_on column which represents a date.

end

This will add some methods to you model class, some of them are used as callback methods, so that you can set a hash to started_on.
Note that this hash must be able to respond to symbol keys.

On the view side, you can use flexible_date_select instead of date_select. This helper holds invalid date values so that the user can see what is wrong.
This plugin does not support non-builder type helper now, but there is a plan to add it later (or please add it).

  <% form_for :your_model do |f| %>
    <%= f.flexible_date_select :started_on %>
  <% end %>
